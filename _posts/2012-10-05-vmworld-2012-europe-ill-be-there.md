Yes, this year I managed to get myself to the European edition of **VMworld**. I'm really excited about it, and the best is that I'll be lucky enough to have spare time during the event to attend some of the most interesting sessions, meet other **vExperts**, hang in the solutions exchange with the partners, engage with some customers and of course go to the parties during the night (see you in the [Veeam](http://go.veeam.com/event-vmworld-europe-aug2012-en.html?ad=home) one ;-)

So if you are coming to Spain for the most awesome tech event the year don't forget to ping me by [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jreypo) or [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/107485549683160294074/)Â :-)

See you in Barcelona my dear readers and friends :D

Juanma.
