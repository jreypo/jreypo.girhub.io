I found this error last week during a deployment in a customer. The **vCenter Infrastructure Navigator** appliance does not maintain its configured hostname after a reboot, it gets reset to the default `localhost.localdom` value.

[![](/images/vin_fail_hostname.png "vIN hostname")]({{site.url}}/images/vin_fail_hostname.png)

Setting it again in the administration web interface doesnâ€™t solve problem, it will be lost again after the next reboot.

The problem is in the `vami_set_hostname` script, it has a `HOSTNAME` variable set to `localhost.localdom` and if it fails to make the reverse lookup of the hostname from the IP address using the host command it will be set to the default value.

[![](/images/vami_script_hostname_variable.png "HOSTNAME variable")]({{site.url}}/images/vami_script_hostname_variable.png)

To fix this edit that file, it can be found on `/opt/vmware/share/vami`, and set the value of the variable to your hostname. After that reboot the appliance to check that everything works as expected.
