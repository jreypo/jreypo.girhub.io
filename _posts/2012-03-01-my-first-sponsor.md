I am very happy to announce that today I get the first sponsor for this blog. The people at **Veeam Software** has been kind enough to take my blog into consideration and for that I'm truly grateful.

**Veeam** doesn't need an introduction, they produce a [fantastic suite for backup & replication](http://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html?ad=menu) in virtual environments, Hyper-V and vSphere, considered by many the best in the market. They also have [Veeam ONE](http://www.veeam.com/vmware-esx-management-one-solution.html?ad=menu), which includes Veeam Monitor, Reporter and Business View, for virtualization environment management and monitoring.

**Veeam** and **HP** have also a joint solution for backup in VMware environments that combines **Veeam Backup & Replication** award winning software and **[HP StorOnce D2D](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/12169-304616-3755723-3755723-3755723-3896393.html?dnr=1)** technology, here it is the link to the [white paper](http://go.veeam.com/rs/veeam/images/HP_Veeam_Technical_Whitepaper.pdf) describing the solution.

Again thanks to **Veeam**, I hope to get my hands on the HP & Veeam solution in the future and write about it.

Juanma.
