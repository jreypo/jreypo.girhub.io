It seems that finally and after a myriad of delays **[Tukwila](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukwila_%28processor%29 "Tukwila")**, the brand new quad-core [Itanium](http://www.intel.com/products/processor/itanium/index.htm) processor from Intel, is going to be released. Yesterday through its
[Chip Shots](http://www.intel.com/pressroom/chipshots/chipshots.htm "Intel PR Chip Shots") bulletin board, Intel announced that *"Tukwila (...) has begun revenue shipments"* and a Q1 launch has to be expected.

There have been [reports](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/02/intel_server_chip_launches/) about an announcement by Intel next Monday, February 8th, during the [ISSCC](http://www.isscc.org/isscc/index.htm "ISSC"). The same place and date chosen by IBM to presents its new [POWER7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER7 "POWER7").

I really hope that Intel finally release Tukwila during ISSCC. This processor will be the core of a brand [new line of HP Integrity](http://www.pcworld.com/article/172909/hp_prepares_new_integrity_servers_for_tukwila_launch.html?tk=rss_news) servers and that means more work for me ;-)

Juanma.
