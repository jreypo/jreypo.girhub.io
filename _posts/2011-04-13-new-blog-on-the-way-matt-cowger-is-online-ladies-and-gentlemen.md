Just read a tweet from **Matt Cowger** ([@mcowger](http://www.twitter.com/mcowger)) saying he started a new technical blog "**[VM's Are Free, Right](http://blog.cowger.us/)**" and I though that I can help him to spread the word :-)

For those of you that know nothing about Matt, he's a colleague from **HP** coming from **3PAR** and recently [joined EMC as vSpecialist](http://blog.cowger.us/?p=26).Â He is a Rockstar in the virtualization industry with the **[#VCDX052](http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=15652&ui=www_cert)** badge under his belt. And far more important than that, he is a great guy.

I'm sure that very soon his blog will be one of the top references in the industry, I already subscribed and you should do it too.

Juanma.
