May be you already know it or may be not, but [Console2](http://unixsadm.blogspot.com/ "Console2") is one of those pieces of software that when you discover it you ask yourself "How was my life before we meet dear?"

I spent so much time in Windows, my corporate laptop has Window XP, the PC at customer site as well so for years I've been looking for something to replace the default CMD window. I've been using Puttycyg for Cygwin but I still needed something for CMD and Powershell and one day I found **Console2** at [Mihai Criveti's](http://unixsadm.blogspot.com/) blog and since then it has replaced every cli interface in my windows boxes.

It has everything you always wanted for a terminal but MS didn't provide, tabs, transparency, multiple shells supported, highly customizable, etc.
