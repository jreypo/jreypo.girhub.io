<p>What can I say? Working for VMware is without any doubt one of the most
awesome and mind-blowing experiences I’ve ever had! During these months
I’ve been involved in some really big vCloud engagements, had the
opportunity to work with vCAC, vCloud, Chargeback, vC Ops and vCO in an
everyday basis and have learn tons of new cool things. I’ve finally
started a personal and professional transition from an infrastructure
role to an automation and development focused one.</p>

<p>And I’ve been awarded as VMware vExpert for third year! :D</p>

<p>Honestly being a consultant at PSO is amazing but it’s also a very
exhausting and time consuming job, there are always lots of new
interesting things to do but not enough time available to try and test
every crazy stuff you find, write on the blog, do your job and attend
your family. As you can imagine not spending time with my family is
completely out of the question and I have to admit that closing the blog
has crossed my mind a couple of times. Instead I’ve decided to organize
better the rest of my life and try to find time every week to write a
couple of posts.</p>

<p>I really enjoy write about my experiences at work, time will tell if I
am able to keep my promise, I really hope so :)</p>

<p>Juanma.</p>
