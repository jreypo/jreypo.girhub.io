      <p>This year edition of <strong>VMworld Europe 2013</strong> is gone. For second time it
was held in Barcelona, one of most beautiful cities of Spain, and for
the second time I was there to enjoy a great week… and what a week.</p>

<p>If you weren’t under a rock during last week you are probably aware of
the announcements in the cloud management space, with new upcoming
releases for vC Ops, ITBM and vCAC just to name some. Or the
announcement of VMware NSX going GA and the tech preview of vSAN.</p>

<p>Regarding the announced vCAC 6.0 the attendees had a glimpse of its
awesomeness in the Hands-on Labs since the HOL-SDC-1321 lab was based on
6.0 Beta bits. vCAC 6.0 was also featured in a very well executed
keynote by Kit Colbert and our EMEA CTO Joe Baguley on Wednesday
morning, showing from all the new features in the portal to the
integration with VMware vCHS and other public cloud providers.</p>

<p>I am genuinely excited about this new vCloud Automation Center release
and will come back with more articles about my experience with it in the
future. In the meantime my friend and colleague Omer has done a nice
<a href="http://elasticskies.com/vcac-6-0-announced/"><strong>article</strong></a> in his blog
<strong><a href="http://elasticskies.com/">Elastic Skies</a></strong> about what’s new.</p>

<p>But that’s only one side of the coin, for me the most important aspect
of VMworld is the <strong>Community</strong>. This is the only time of the year I
have the opportunity to hang face to face with many of the people I
already consider my friends, this is I’m not sales, marketing or social
media, I am a consultant as you all know and that means that I’m always
in the field doing engagements for customers and having lots of fun of
course but that leave me no time or even the chance to attend tech
conferences… besides VMworld :-)</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#333333;font-size:medium;">And this year has been
AWESOME!</span></strong></p>

<p>I had again the opportunity of attending several parties. Parties are
always sponsored by several companies, like Cisco, EMC or Simplivity,
but in some of them the sense of community is omnipresent.</p>

<p>Take the <strong>vRockstar Party</strong> for example, held on Sunday evening at the
<strong><a href="http://www.hardrock.com/locations/cafes3/cafe.aspx?LocationID=41&amp;MIBEnumID=3">Hard Rock
Cafe</a></strong>.
That really was a community event, the perfect moment to share a few
beers (more than a few actually ;D) a good conversations and strength
your friendship with the other members of the community. Or the
<strong>GeekFest</strong> on Tuesday night, again at the Hard Rock and sponsored by
EMC, Cisco and VMware. Oh man that party was really great with amazing
food and beer and many many friends from all around the world there.</p>

<p>But for me the best example this year was the <strong>#BeerTweetup</strong>
organized by Hans De Leenheer
(<a href="https://twitter.com/HansDeLeenheer">@HansDeLeenheer</a>) and sponsored by
Simplivity. IMHO that was a true community event, no marketing, no
vendor swag, just good Belgium beer, great talking and good company.</p>

<p>But hey it wasn’t all about the parties, at least no during the night
you know, seriously parties are amazing but it was the only part of the
fun. During all day, for three days, some of the most active and
prominent members of the VMware community were spreading the word in the
Community Lounge. I’m taking about the guys of
<strong><a href="http://professionalvmware.com/brownbags/">#vBrownbag</a></strong> or James
Bowling (<a href="https://twitter.com/vsential">@vsentia</a>l) and his
<strong><a href="http://vsential.com/2013/10/operation-eyes-tmevmworld/">Operation: Through my
eyes</a></strong> series
of videos or Craig Waters (<a href="https://twitter.com/cswaters1">@cswaters1</a>)
who interviewed many other vExperts for his
<a href="http://craigwaters.org/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Also for me this VMworld has been very special since I had the
opportunity to contribute to the community besides of this blog, and of
my awesome drinking skills of course ;D My friend Amy Lewis
(<a href="https://twitter.com/CommsNinja">@CommsNinja</a>) finally manage to got me
into her video podcast <strong><a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/tag/engineers-unplugged/">Engineers
Unplugged</a></strong>, Amy and
his team really know how to bring social media and community to a
different level. As my “opponent” I had Matthew Yeager himself
(<a href="https://twitter.com/mpyeager">@mpyeager</a>) from EMC and we had tons of
fun recording it and talking about cloud management, APIs and the
Software Defined Datacenter. As soon as Amy gets the video up in the
show <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/engineersunplugged">YouTube channel</a> I
will feature it here.</p>

<p>My final though is if next year you have the opportunity of going to
VMworld, either US or Europe, take it and show up in the community
lounge to have some good conversations with the great people there, show
your support to that people, get into the parties and enjoy the
conference. You won’t regret it, surely I didn’t :-)</p>

<p>Juanma.</p>
