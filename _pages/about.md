I am Juan Manuel Rey, I live in Madrid with my incredible son Jaime and Buffy, our adorable lady poodle. My kid and myself are proud die hard Star Wars fans, as you can see in the picture.

## What I do for a living...

I am an engineer with more than twenty years of experience in the industry as Unix, Virtualization and Cloud professional, and great experience in design and administer mission critical environments. Currently I am working at Microsoft Azure engineering as Senior Program Manager in the Azure VMware Solution product group. Although I work for Microsoft I still consider myself a Unix Geek and a Unix BSD fanboy.

Previously I have worked for Red Hat and VMware, in their consulting organizations, amongst others.

I've been lucky enough to be awarded as **VMware vExpert** from 2011 to 2016. I'm interested in everything related to Unix, virtualization, cloud, distributed systems and DevOps.
