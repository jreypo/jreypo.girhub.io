I'm Juan Manuel Rey, I live in Madrid with my incredible wife Gemma, our son Jaime and Buffy, our adorable lady poddle.

## What I do for a living...

I am a Senior Consultant working for VMware Professional Services, specialized in [NSX](https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx), [vCloud Director](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcloud-director) and [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org).

With more than fifteen years of experience in the industry as Unix, Virtualization and Cloud professional, with great experience in architecting and administer mission critical environments. Currently working at VMware as Senior Consultant focused on automation, cloud and network virtualization.

I've been lucky enough to be awarded as **VMware vExpert** from 2011 to 2015. I'm interested in everything related to Unix, VMware, cloud, Python, distributed systems and DevOps.
