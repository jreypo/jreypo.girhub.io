I am Juan Manuel Rey, I live in Madrid with my incredible wife Gemma, our son Jaime and Buffy, our adorable lady poodle. My kid and myself are die hard Star Wars fans, as you can see in the picture.

## What I do for a living...

[![](/images/radio_cto_v6.png)]({{site.url}}/images/radio_cto_v6.png)

I am a Senior Consultant working for VMware Professional Services, specialized in [NSX](https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx), [vCloud Director](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcloud-director) and [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org). With more than fifteen years of experience in the industry as Unix, Virtualization and Cloud professional, and great experience in architecting and administer mission critical environments.

I am also a [CTO Ambassador](http://blogs.vmware.com/cto/author/ctoambassadors/) at VMware, if you want to know more about us I suggest the article from my Chinese brother [Iwan Rahabok](https://twitter.com/e1_ang) [**On being a VMware CTO Ambassador**](http://virtual-red-dot.info/on-being-a-vmware-cto-ambassador/).

I've been lucky enough to be awarded as **VMware vExpert** from 2011 to 2015. I'm interested in everything related to Unix, VMware, cloud, Python, distributed systems and DevOps.
