I am a Senior Consultant working for VMware Professional Services, specialized in [NSX](https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx), [vCloud Director](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcloud-director) and [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org). I am also a [CTO Ambassador](http://blogs.vmware.com/cto/author/ctoambassadors/) at VMware, if you want to know more about us I suggest the article from my Chinese brother Iwan [On being a VMware CTO Ambassador](http://virtual-red-dot.info/on-being-a-vmware-cto-ambassador/).

With more than fifteen years of experience in the industry as Unix, Virtualization and Cloud professional, with great experience in architecting and administer mission critical environments.

I've been lucky enough to be awarded as **VMware vExpert** from 2011 to 2015. I'm interested in everything related to Unix, VMware, cloud, Python, distributed systems and DevOps.
